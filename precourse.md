**Unix/Linux Tutorial**

**The three first part from the [UNIX Tutorial for Beginners](../../ngsintro/common/unixtut/)**  

* [**Introduction**](../../ngsintro/common/unixtut/unixintro.html)  
* [**chapter 1**](../../ngsintro/common/unixtut/unix1.html)  
* [**chapter 2**](../../ngsintro/common/unixtut/unix2.html)  

You must use [http://uppnex.se/emu/](http://uppnex.se/emu/) [(or this mirror)](http://bellard.org/jslinux/) to try the commands in the tutorial, otherwise the commands will not work. 
If you any questions regarding this tutorial contact: martin.dahlo@scilifelab.uu.se

* Using Linux is often the hardest part of the course, so being familiar with writing things on a command-line will help.  
You should at least go through the exercises in the tutorial, no need to know it by heart.  

**Using UPPMAX**

* Make sure that you can login to UPPMAX from your computer before the course starts. Follow these instructions:  
[https://www.uppmax.uu.se/getting-started-first-login-to-uppmax](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/getting-started-first-login-to-uppmax)  

* It is possible to use Mac, Unix/Linux or Windows. (Windows will require installing a special program that you'll find in the instructions.)
